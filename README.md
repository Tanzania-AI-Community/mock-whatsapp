# Mock WhatsApp Interface

A minimalist WhatsApp clone built with Next.js for developing and testing WhatsApp chatbots in a controlled environment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Purposes Only

This application is designed exclusively for development and testing purposes. It is NOT intended for production use or as a replacement for the official WhatsApp application.

## üöÄ Purpose

This project provides a sandbox environment that allows developers to:

- Test WhatsApp chatbot responses without using actual WhatsApp infrastructure
- Simulate conversations between users and bots
- Develop and debug webhooks and API integrations
- Test the UI/UX of chatbot interactions in a WhatsApp-like interface

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time messaging**: Send and receive messages with persistent storage
- **WhatsApp-like UI**: Familiar interface mimicking WhatsApp Web
- **Message status indicators**: "Sending", "Sent", and "Error" states
- **Temporary message handling**: Optimistic updates with server reconciliation
- **Auto-scrolling**: Smart scroll behavior that respects user interactions
- **Database integration**: PostgreSQL backend for message persistence
- **API webhook integration**: Connect to your own chatbot backend services
- **Connection status handling**: Graceful handling of connectivity issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js Server Actions, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
